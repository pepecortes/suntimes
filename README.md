## suntimes

A Haskell CLI application that displays sunrise and sunset times for the specified locations.

Contains examples of how to use external APIs, error handling and application logging.

My own practice of [chapter 7 ERROR HANDLING AND LOGGING](https://livebook.manning.com/book/haskell-in-depth/chapter-7?origin=product-toc) from the book [Haskell in Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/haskell-in-depth)
